// An encoding_state object stores some state about a specific blob.
// i.e. number_of_fragments, size_of_last_fragment and most importantly a padded version of the last fragment.
// To avoid lookups in a hash map for each symbol it stores a pointer to the right degree_calculator (a robust soliton distribution).
// Note: I don't know how to produce values from a robust soliton distribution directly.
// For that reason I create discrete distributions after calculating all probabilities for each symbol.
// I keep such a discrete distribution for each possible number of fragments.
// This could potentially create concurrency issues but I will probably just have separate Encoders for each core.
